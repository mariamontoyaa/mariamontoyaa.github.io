### Studying a Masters at PSE

<details>
<summary> Which program did you study at PSE? </summary>


I joined the Analysis and Policy in Economics (APE) program in September 2019. The program is designed as follows:

- The first year (M1) offers a traditional master's in Economics approach. It introduces students to core theories in microeconomics and macroeconomics, along with training in econometrics. Assessments typically include problem sets and exams. While it resembles the initial year of a PhD program, there's less emphasis on real analysis or formal proofs.

- The second year (M2) is comprised solely of elective courses and a thesis seminar. Students have the flexibility to specialize in a particular field or combine various subjects based on their interests. Classes are more intimate, focusing on specific topics and centered around discussions of research papers. For the master's thesis, students select an advisor early in the year and develop their thesis (or "memoire") under their guidance..

<summary> Why did you choose PSE and the APE program?  </summary>

I began exploring master's programs during my final semester at university. My interest in the Paris School of Economics (PSE) grew after reading research papers by their faculty in my senior year. Initially, I was seeking a research-oriented master's due to my interest for academic studies and aspirations to work within international organizations. My main aim was to find a reputable university to deepen my understanding of Economics.

Choosing PSE wasn't a particularly strategic choice on my part. I was looking at European programs, influenced in part by my brother's residence in the Netherlands and my previous positive experience studying in Barcelona for a semester. Given that PSE had a relatively low tuition of around €300 per academic year and no application fee, I decided it was worth a try. Fortunately, I found myself in an environment where I thrived, laying a strong foundation for my subsequent academic pursuits.

Reflecting on my journey, I would recommend PSE and its APE program to those interested in economic research, even if they are uncertain about pursuing a PhD. The PSE department offers a diverse range of expertise, providing ample opportunities for exploration. While the first year of the program is demanding, it is manageable for dedicated students with a solid undergraduate background. However, if your goal is to acquire practical, hands-on skills quickly, you might consider other options, as this is not the primary focus of the APE program or many similar economics master's programs.

<summary> What is the difference between the APE and PPD programs? </summary>
APE (Analysis in Policy in Economics) is a general program in Economics that covers most fields and is research-oriented. The PPD (Public Policy and Development) is considered the applied masters in PSE and focuses on developing skills for the evaluation of public policies. 

Both programs have a strong core of applied microeconomics and econometrics. APE covers more content of other fields like macroeconomics, industrial organization, trade, and has a strongest focus on theory. The everyday experience in the program is very different, at least for the first year. APE consists of individual work attending lectures, working on problem sets and preparing for exams. In contrast, PPD involves more team work, many class projects and some presentations.  

At the time of applying I wasn't very sure of my choice of APE over PPD because I had a strong interest in public policies and wanted to work on their evaluation, which clearly suggests that I would enjoy the PPD program. I decided to choose curiosity over specialization and go for APE because I wanted to also learn about macroeconomics and explore economic theories.

<summary> How did you fund your masters at PSE? </summary>

Tuition fees are around €300 per year (though this could change with the new immigration law). As a student, you spend between €800-1100 every month for living expenses in Paris (see more details in the Living in France section). 

For the first year, I was awarded an APE program scholarship for students from developing countries that granted €500 per month. I covered the rest of my living expenses from savings and help from my parents. I'm not sure if this scholarship still exists but it is not advertised. 

For the second year, I was awarded an [Eiffel Scholarship](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/france-excellence-eiffel-scholarship-program), which amounted to around €1100 euros per month, waived tuition fees, and included a round-trip ticket between Paris and my hometown. See details on how to apply below. 


Some other scholarships available for Mexicans are CONACYT FUNED or FIDERH (loans from Banxico). Alternatively, there are a few research prizes that you can submit your undergrad thesis to and can help you fund some of your studies. For example: [Premio Banamex de Economía](https://www.banamex.com/premioeconomia/index.html),  [Premio Nacional de las Finanzas Públicas](https://www.cefp.gob.mx/new/premio_nacional.php), and [Premio COFECE de Ensayo](https://www.cofece.mx/premioensayo2021/).

<summary> How was your experience in the program? </summary>
A global pandemic happened at the end of my first year. The second year was mostly online because we were in some form of confinement between November 2020 and April 2021.

Still, I enjoyed my experience in the masters very much. I think this was mainly due to three reasons. 

First, I made great friends in the program who made the work easier, were very fun to be around, and they became a great support system in times of need. 

Second, I had great foundations from my undergrad in Mexico. The university where I studied was specialized in Economics and I had been previously exposed to many of the topics that I studied during the first year. Also, I had experience learning Economics in English because I did a semester abroad, most of my courses then were in English, and even in my undergrad, where classes were thaught in Spanish we read some textbooks and academic papers in English. 

Third, my main objective during the masters was to learn new things and enjoy. I tried to let go of any expectations of my academic performance and focus on working hard. I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted to do after the masters so I allowed myself to focus on the material and explore. 

As any other high quality economics masters, APE requires a lot of hard work and is very demanding. Apart from this, a big issue is that many of us arrive to the program focused on the desired outcome (getting a prestigious job, entering into a top PhD program) and focus little on the process of what we are learning. It is common to follow the inertia of looking for the next prestigious degree, and end up in a program you don't enjoy.
