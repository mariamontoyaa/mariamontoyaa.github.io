## About me

I am an Economics PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/){:target="_blank"} and [Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/page-perso/mmontoya){:target="_blank"} working under the supervision of David Margolis. 

I’m interested in a wide range of topics in development economics. Currently. I'm working at the intersection of development, labor, and crime economics. My dissertation studies how organized crime transforms local labor markets in Mexico and how to encourage youth to invest in their education in similar contexts. 

Previously, I worked as an Economic Analyst at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), where,along with my colleagues, we developed various reports to inform the public policy strategies worldwide to respond to the social protection needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.
